## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
Goal
•	Build deep convolution neuron network to classify traffic sign images
•	Achieve test accuracy larger than 0.93

Dataset Exploration
---
This project includes three datasets: training, validation, and testing datasets, and the size of each dataset is shown in the table.
Training	Validation	Testing
34799	4410	12630
For each single RBG image, the size is 32 pixels by 32 pixels.  Three sample images are shown below;

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

### Dataset and Repository

1. Download the data set. The classroom has a link to the data set in the "Project Instructions" content. This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.
2. Clone the project, which contains the Ipython notebook and the writeup template.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
cd CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
```

### Requirements for Submission
Follow the instructions in the `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb` notebook and write the project report using the writeup template as a guide, `writeup_template.md`. Submit the project code and writeup document.
